A very mathematical and sterile world. Up to you to change that, if you dare.

This mod in it's current state is a technical prototype. Mainly it is used to test the feasability
of theotown modding. Perhaps it will dictate the future of the modding scene for theotown. Most likely
not though.

## Building

This mod can be built through maven, invoking `mvn package` ought to be enough should you have maven installed.
The built jar will be located in the "target" folder.
